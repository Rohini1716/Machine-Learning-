# ðŸš— **ML Project â€“ Used Car Price Prediction**

# ðŸ“Œ **Overview**

This project focuses on predicting used car prices using different Machine Learning models. It walks through data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling with a complete end-to-end pipeline.

# ðŸ“Š **Dataset**

The dataset contains information about used cars, including features such as:

Car details (brand, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.)

Market-related attributes (selling price, owner type, etc.)

# ðŸ§© **Steps Covered**

Data Loading & Exploration â€“ Importing libraries, loading the dataset, and viewing the data.

Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, feature transformations, and applying functions.

Data Visualization â€“ Histogram, Boxplot, and Heatmap for insights.

Modeling â€“

* Linear Regression

* Decision Tree Regression

* Support Vector Regression (SVR)

* Model Saving â€“ Exporting trained models for reuse.

* Complete Analysis â€“ Step-by-step evaluation with visual insights.
